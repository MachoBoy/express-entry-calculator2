# Express Entry Calculator #

## Purpose ##
One of my friend wanted to calculate his Express Entry Points.
There is official calculator provided by Canadian government.
When I tried the calculator, it is easy to use, but it's not detail enough.
It does not contain all the requirements statement.
For that reason, I wanted to develop the calculator.
It provides more user friendly environment and each table contain detail information.

## Objective ##
* User Friendly environment
* Enable to save current points 
* Add History section
